to download and preview it locally, run:

```
git clone git@github.com:ealopia/ealopia.git
npm i
npm run start
```

make sure you've created your own `.env` file with the relevant secrets!

namely,

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=stuff
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=morestuff
```

currently using this calligraphy-based font which i love love love: https://github.com/Kinutafontfactory/Yuji/blob/master/documentation/documentation.pdf
